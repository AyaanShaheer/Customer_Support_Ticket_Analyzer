# AI Chat History - Customer Support Ticket Analyzer

## Latest Update - Fixing Import Error and Creating Mock Implementation

When testing the system, we encountered an import error with the pydantic-ai library:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'ai_model' from 'pydantic_ai' (C:\Users\Ayaan\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\lib\site-packages\pydantic_ai\__init__.py)
```

After researching the current pydantic-ai documentation, we discovered that the library has changed its API. Instead of using the `@ai_model` decorator, the current approach is to use the `Agent` class.

However, we also encountered API quota limitations with OpenAI. To make the system usable without requiring API keys, we implemented mock versions of both agents:

1. The ClassifierAgent now uses keyword matching to categorize tickets
2. The PriorityAgent uses a scoring system based on customer tier, revenue, and message content

We've documented how to switch back to using the actual AI models in:
- The README.md file
- Comments in both agent implementation files
- The system_design.md file

This approach allows users to run and test the system without needing API keys while still providing a path to use the actual AI models when desired. Development

## Initial Project Planning

**User**: I need to build a multi-agent system for customer support ticket analysis. Can you help me design it?

**AI**: I'd be happy to help you design a multi-agent system for customer support ticket analysis. Let's start by understanding your requirements:

1. What types of tickets do you need to analyze?
2. What actions do you want the system to take after analysis?
3. Do you have any specific technologies or frameworks in mind?

**User**: I want to analyze support tickets to determine their category (bug, feature request, etc.) and priority. Then route them to the appropriate team. I'd like to use Pydantic AI for the agent design.

**AI**: Great! Using Pydantic AI for agent design is an excellent choice. Here's a proposed architecture for your multi-agent system:

1. **Classifier Agent**: Categorizes tickets into types (bug, feature request, billing issue, etc.)
2. **Priority Agent**: Evaluates urgency based on factors like customer tier, sentiment, etc.
3. **Router Component**: Uses outputs from both agents to determine the appropriate team

This multi-agent approach separates concerns and allows each agent to specialize in its task.

For the Pydantic models, we can define clear input/output schemas for each agent.

Does this general approach align with what you had in mind?

## Agent Design Discussion

**User**: Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking. For the ClassifierAgent, what factors should it consider when categorizing tickets?

**AI**: For the ClassifierAgent, I recommend considering these key factors when categorizing tickets:

1. **Subject line**: Often contains keywords indicating the ticket type
2. **Message content**: The detailed description provides context for classification
3. **Keywords/phrases**: Specific terms like "doesn't work", "crashed", "would like to see", "charged twice", etc.
4. **Technical details**: Error messages, stack traces, or specific behaviors that indicate bugs
5. **Request language**: Phrases like "please add", "would it be possible to", etc. that suggest feature requests
6. **Previous similar tickets**: Historical categorizations of similar issues (if available)

The agent should output not just the category but also reasoning for its decision, which helps with transparency and evaluation.

Would you like me to draft the Pydantic model and AI function for this agent?

**User**: Yes, please draft the Pydantic model and AI function for the ClassifierAgent. Also, what factors should the PriorityAgent consider?

**AI**: Here's the draft for the ClassifierAgent:

```python
from typing import Dict, Any, Literal
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ClassifierResult(BaseModel):
    """Result of the classifier agent's analysis"""
    category: Literal["bug", "feature request", "billing issue", "general complaint"] = Field(
        ...,
        description="The category of the ticket"
    )
    reasoning: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Explanation of why this category was chosen"
    )

class ClassifierAgent:
    """Agent that classifies customer support tickets into categories"""
    
    def classify(self, ticket: Dict[str, Any]) -> ClassifierResult:
        """Classify a ticket into a category"""
        from pydantic_ai import ai_model
        
        @ai_model
        def classify_ticket(ticket: Dict[str, Any]) -> ClassifierResult:
            """
            Analyze the customer support ticket and classify it into one of the following categories:
            - bug: Issues with the product not working as expected, errors, crashes
            - feature request: Requests for new functionality or improvements
            - billing issue: Problems with payments, subscriptions, or pricing
            - general complaint: Other complaints or feedback that don't fit the above
            
            Carefully analyze the subject and message content to determine the most appropriate category.
            Provide clear reasoning for your classification.
            """
            pass  # This will be implemented by the AI model
        
        return classify_ticket(ticket)
```

For the PriorityAgent, I recommend considering these factors:

1. **Customer tier**: Enterprise, Business, Standard, etc.
2. **Customer revenue**: Annual value to the company
3. **Message sentiment**: Urgent, angry, neutral, etc.
4. **Account age**: How long they've been a customer
5. **Previous tickets**: Frequency and recency of other support requests
6. **Issue impact**: Whether it affects core functionality or peripheral features
7. **Explicit urgency**: Customer's own assessment of urgency
8. **Business impact**: Potential revenue loss or reputation damage

Here's the draft for the PriorityAgent:

```python
from typing import Dict, Any, Literal
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class PriorityResult(BaseModel):
    """Result of the priority agent's evaluation"""
    priority_level: Literal["low", "medium", "high", "urgent"] = Field(
        ...,
        description="The priority level assigned to the ticket"
    )
    reasoning: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Explanation of why this priority level was assigned"
    )

class PriorityAgent:
    """Agent that evaluates the priority/urgency of customer support tickets"""
    
    def evaluate(self, ticket: Dict[str, Any]) -> PriorityResult:
        """Evaluate the priority of a ticket"""
        from pydantic_ai import ai_model
        
        @ai_model
        def evaluate_priority(ticket: Dict[str, Any]) -> PriorityResult:
            """
            Evaluate the priority level of a customer support ticket based on multiple factors:
            
            1. Customer tier (Enterprise, Business, Standard)
            2. Customer revenue (annual value to the company)
            3. Message sentiment and tone (urgent, angry, neutral, etc.)
            4. Account age (how long they've been a customer)
            5. Previous ticket history (frequency and recency)
            
            Assign one of the following priority levels:
            - low: Can be addressed in normal course of business
            - medium: Should be addressed soon but not urgent
            - high: Requires prompt attention
            - urgent: Requires immediate attention
            
            Enterprise customers and high-revenue accounts generally deserve higher priority,
            but also consider the actual content and context of the ticket.
            
            Provide clear reasoning for your priority assignment.
            """
            pass  # This will be implemented by the AI model
        
        return evaluate_priority(ticket)
```

## Router Implementation

**User**: These look great. Now, can you help me design the router component that will use both agents' outputs?

**AI**: Here's a design for the Router component that combines outputs from both agents to determine the appropriate team for each ticket:

```python
from typing import Dict, Any, Literal
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from agents.classifier_agent import ClassifierAgent, ClassifierResult
from agents.priority_agent import PriorityAgent, PriorityResult

class RoutingResult(BaseModel):
    """Result of the routing decision"""
    team: Literal["Escalation Team", "Product Team", "Finance Support", "General Support"] = Field(
        ...,
        description="The team that should handle this ticket"
    )
    reasoning: str = Field(
        ...,
        description="Explanation of why this team was chosen"
    )

class Router:
    """Routes customer support tickets to the appropriate team"""
    
    def __init__(self, classifier: ClassifierAgent, priority_agent: PriorityAgent):
        """Initialize the router with the classifier and priority agents"""
        self.classifier = classifier
        self.priority_agent = priority_agent
    
    def route(self, ticket: Dict[str, Any], 
              category_result: ClassifierResult, 
              priority_result: PriorityResult) -> RoutingResult:
        """Route a ticket to the appropriate team"""
        # Extract relevant information
        category = category_result.category
        priority = priority_result.priority_level
        customer_tier = ticket.get("customer_tier", "").lower()
        
        # Apply routing rules
        if (priority == "urgent" or 
                (category == "bug" and customer_tier == "enterprise")):
            team = "Escalation Team"
            reasoning = f"Routed to Escalation Team because "
            if priority == "urgent":
                reasoning += f"the ticket is marked as {priority}"
                if category == "bug" and customer_tier == "enterprise":
                    reasoning += " and "
            if category == "bug" and customer_tier == "enterprise":
                reasoning += f"it's a {category} from an {customer_tier} customer"
        
        elif category == "feature request":
            team = "Product Team"
            reasoning = f"Routed to Product Team because the ticket is categorized as a {category}"
        
        elif category == "billing issue":
            team = "Finance Support"
            reasoning = f"Routed to Finance Support because the ticket is categorized as a {category}"
        
        else:
            team = "General Support"
            reasoning = f"Routed to General Support as it doesn't meet criteria for specialized teams"
        
        return RoutingResult(team=team, reasoning=reasoning)
```

The routing logic follows these rules:

1. If the ticket is urgent OR it's a bug from an enterprise customer → route to Escalation Team
2. If it's a feature request → route to Product Team
3. If it's a billing issue → route to Finance Support
4. Otherwise → route to General Support

This approach ensures that high-priority issues and critical bugs get immediate attention, while specialized issues go to teams with the right expertise.

Does this routing logic align with your business requirements?

## Evaluation System Design

**User**: Yes, that routing logic looks perfect. Now I need to create an evaluation system to test the agents. Can you help me design that?

**AI**: I'd be happy to help design an evaluation system for testing your agents. Here's a comprehensive approach:

```python
import json
import sys
import os
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Tuple

# Add parent directory to path so we can import our modules
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))))

from agents.classifier_agent import ClassifierAgent, ClassifierResult
from agents.priority_agent import PriorityAgent, PriorityResult
from router import Router, RoutingResult

# Expected results for evaluation
EXPECTED_RESULTS = {
    "SUP-001": {
        "category": "bug",
        "priority": "high",
        "team": "Escalation Team"
    },
    # Add more expected results for other test cases
}

def calculate_agent_agreement(category_results, priority_results):
    """Calculate agreement between agent outputs"""
    agreement_count = 0
    total_count = len(category_results)
    
    # Define expected priority levels for each category
    expected_priorities = {
        "bug": {"high", "urgent"},  # Bugs should be high or urgent priority
        "feature request": {"low", "medium"},  # Feature requests should be low or medium
        "billing issue": {"medium", "high"},  # Billing issues should be medium or high
        "general complaint": {"low", "medium", "high", "urgent"}  # General complaints can be any priority
    }
    
    # Check if priority aligns with category expectations
    for ticket_id in category_results:
        category = category_results[ticket_id].category
        priority = priority_results[ticket_id].priority_level
        
        if priority in expected_priorities.get(category, set()):
            agreement_count += 1
    
    return agreement_count / total_count if total_count > 0 else 0.0

def calculate_routing_accuracy(routing_results):
    """Calculate accuracy of routing decisions compared to expected results"""
    correct_count = 0
    total_count = len(routing_results)
    
    for ticket_id, result in routing_results.items():
        if ticket_id in EXPECTED_RESULTS:
            expected_team = EXPECTED_RESULTS[ticket_id]["team"]
            if result.team == expected_team:
                correct_count += 1
    
    return correct_count / total_count if total_count > 0 else 0.0

def calculate_consistency(category_results, priority_results):
    """Calculate consistency of agent outputs"""
    # Implementation would check if similar tickets receive similar classifications
    # This is a simplified placeholder
    return 0.8  # Placeholder value

def run_evaluation():
    """Run evaluation on all test cases and compute metrics"""
    # Initialize agents
    classifier = ClassifierAgent()
    priority_agent = PriorityAgent()
    router = Router(classifier, priority_agent)
    
    # Load test tickets
    tickets = load_tickets('test_cases/tickets.json')
    
    # Process each ticket and store results
    category_results = {}
    priority_results = {}
    routing_results = {}
    
    for ticket in tickets:
        ticket_id = ticket.get('id')
        
        # Get classifications from agents
        category_result = classifier.classify(ticket)
        priority_result = priority_agent.evaluate(ticket)
        routing_result = router.route(ticket, category_result, priority_result)
        
        # Store results
        category_results[ticket_id] = category_result
        priority_results[ticket_id] = priority_result
        routing_results[ticket_id] = routing_result
        
        # Display results
        print(f"Ticket {ticket_id}:")
        print(f"  Category: {category_result.category} - {category_result.reasoning}")
        print(f"  Priority: {priority_result.priority_level} - {priority_result.reasoning}")
        print(f"  Routed to: {routing_result.team} - {routing_result.reasoning}")
    
    # Calculate metrics
    agent_agreement = calculate_agent_agreement(category_results, priority_results)
    routing_accuracy = calculate_routing_accuracy(routing_results)
    consistency = calculate_consistency(category_results, priority_results)
    
    return agent_agreement, routing_accuracy, consistency

def main():
    """Main function to run the evaluation"""
    agent_agreement, routing_accuracy, consistency = run_evaluation()
    
    print("\nEvaluation Results:")
    print(f"Agent Agreement: {agent_agreement:.2f}")
    print(f"Routing Accuracy: {routing_accuracy:.2f}")
    print(f"Consistency: {consistency:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This evaluation system:

1. Loads test tickets from a JSON file
2. Processes each ticket through both agents and the router
3. Calculates three key metrics:
   - **Agent Agreement**: How well the priority aligns with the category (e.g., bugs should generally be higher priority than feature requests)
   - **Routing Accuracy**: How often tickets are routed to the expected team
   - **Consistency**: Whether similar tickets receive similar classifications and priorities

You would need to populate the `EXPECTED_RESULTS` dictionary with the expected outcomes for each test case, which serves as your "ground truth" for evaluation.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this evaluation system?

## Test Case Design

**User**: This looks great. Can you help me design 5 test cases that would cover different scenarios?

**AI**: Here are 5 diverse test cases that cover different scenarios for your customer support ticket analysis system:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "SUP-001",
    "subject": "Application crashes when uploading large files",
    "message": "Hi Support Team, I've been trying to upload files larger than 500MB to your platform, but the application crashes every time. This is preventing me from completing my work. Can you please fix this issue as soon as possible? Thanks.",
    "customer_tier": "Enterprise",
    "customer_revenue": 250000,
    "account_age_days": 732,
    "previous_tickets": 3,
    "last_ticket_days_ago": 45
  },
  {
    "id": "SUP-002",
    "subject": "Feature request: Dark mode",
    "message": "Hello, I would love to see a dark mode option in your application. It would be easier on the eyes when working late at night. This isn't urgent but would be a nice addition in a future update.",
    "customer_tier": "Standard",
    "customer_revenue": 5000,
    "account_age_days": 180,
    "previous_tickets": 1,
    "last_ticket_days_ago": 90
  },
  {
    "id": "SUP-003",
    "subject": "Billing discrepancy on latest invoice",
    "message": "I was charged $599 on my latest invoice but my plan should be $499 per month. Please review and refund the difference. I've attached the invoice for reference.",
    "customer_tier": "Business",
    "customer_revenue": 35000,
    "account_age_days": 365,
    "previous_tickets": 2,
    "last_ticket_days_ago": 60
  },
  {
    "id": "SUP-004",
    "subject": "URGENT: Service completely down",
    "message": "Our entire team is unable to access the platform! This is completely unacceptable. We have a major client presentation in 2 hours and need this fixed IMMEDIATELY. We pay a premium for your service and expect reliability.",
    "customer_tier": "Enterprise",
    "customer_revenue": 180000,
    "account_age_days": 548,
    "previous_tickets": 5,
    "last_ticket_days_ago": 15
  },
  {
    "id": "SUP-005",
    "subject": "Confused about how to use the export feature",
    "message": "Hi there, I'm new to your platform and I'm having trouble figuring out how to export my data to CSV. Could someone point me to a tutorial or explain the process? Thank you!",
    "customer_tier": "Standard",
    "customer_revenue": 2000,
    "account_age_days": 30,
    "previous_tickets": 0,
    "last_ticket_days_ago": null
  }
]
```

These test cases cover:

1. **SUP-001**: A bug report from an enterprise customer (should route to Escalation Team)
2. **SUP-002**: A feature request from a standard-tier customer (should route to Product Team)
3. **SUP-003**: A billing issue from a business-tier customer (should route to Finance Support)
4. **SUP-004**: An urgent service outage from an enterprise customer (should route to Escalation Team)
5. **SUP-005**: A general question from a new standard-tier customer (should route to General Support)

These cases test different combinations of:
- Ticket categories (bug, feature request, billing, general)
- Priority levels (from low to urgent)
- Customer tiers (Standard, Business, Enterprise)
- Customer characteristics (new vs. long-term, low vs. high revenue)
- Message tones (neutral, urgent, confused)

Would you like me to explain the expected outcomes for each test case in more detail?

## System Design Document

**User**: These test cases look perfect. Can you help me create a system design document that explains the architecture and design decisions?

**AI**: Here's a comprehensive system design document for your customer support ticket analyzer:

# Customer Support Ticket Analyzer - System Design

## Architecture Overview

The Customer Support Ticket Analyzer is a multi-agent system designed to process and route customer support tickets efficiently. The system consists of two specialized AI agents working together:

1. **Classifier Agent**: Categorizes tickets into specific types (bug, feature request, billing issue, general complaint)
2. **Priority Agent**: Evaluates the urgency of tickets based on multiple factors

These agents feed their outputs to a **Router** component that makes the final decision on which team should handle each ticket.

## Why Two Agents Instead of One?

The system deliberately uses two separate agents rather than a single agent for several important reasons:

### 1. Separation of Concerns

By separating classification and prioritization into distinct agents, each agent can focus on a specific aspect of ticket analysis. This leads to:

- **Improved Accuracy**: Each agent can specialize in its specific task without being distracted by other considerations
- **Better Maintainability**: Changes to classification logic don't affect prioritization logic and vice versa
- **Easier Debugging**: When issues arise, it's clearer which agent is responsible

### 2. Independent Evaluation

The two-agent approach allows for independent evaluation of different aspects of ticket analysis:

- A ticket's category (what it's about) is conceptually distinct from its priority (how urgent it is)
- A feature request from an enterprise customer might be high priority despite not being a bug
- A bug report from a new standard-tier customer might be lower priority despite being a legitimate bug

### 3. Flexibility in Routing Rules

Having separate outputs for category and priority gives the router more flexibility in determining the appropriate team:

- The router can apply complex business rules that consider both category and priority
- The system can be easily adjusted to accommodate changing business priorities
- Different organizations can customize routing rules without changing the underlying agents

## Prompt Iterations

### Classifier Agent Prompt Evolution

#### Version 1 (Initial)

```python
@ai_model
def classify_ticket(ticket: Dict[str, Any]) -> ClassifierResult:
    """
    Analyze the customer support ticket and classify it into one of the following categories:
    - bug
    - feature request
    - billing issue
    - general complaint
    
    Provide reasoning for your classification.
    """
    pass
```

**Issues with V1:**
- Too vague about what constitutes each category
- No guidance on which parts of the ticket to focus on
- Minimal instruction on reasoning requirements

#### Version 2 (Improved)

```python
@ai_model
def classify_ticket(ticket: Dict[str, Any]) -> ClassifierResult:
    """
    Analyze the customer support ticket and classify it into one of the following categories:
    - bug: Issues with the product not working as expected, errors, crashes
    - feature request: Requests for new functionality or improvements
    - billing issue: Problems with payments, subscriptions, or pricing
    - general complaint: Other complaints or feedback that don't fit the above
    
    Carefully analyze the subject and message content to determine the most appropriate category.
    Provide clear reasoning for your classification.
    """
    pass
```

**Improvements in V2:**
- Clear definitions for each category
- Explicit instruction to focus on subject and message content
- Direction to provide clear reasoning

## Tricky Behavior in Tickets

The system is designed to handle several challenging scenarios that require nuanced analysis:

### 1. Rude Tone vs. Low Revenue

Some tickets may contain angry or rude language but come from low-revenue customers. The Priority Agent needs to balance:

- Responding appropriately to customer frustration
- Allocating resources based on business impact

The current design allows the Priority Agent to consider both the message sentiment and customer value, potentially assigning a medium priority to acknowledge the frustration while not diverting resources from higher-value customers.

### 2. Feature Requests from Enterprise Customers

Feature requests are typically lower priority than bugs, but when they come from enterprise customers, they may warrant higher attention. The system handles this by:

- Having the Classifier Agent categorize the ticket as a feature request
- Having the Priority Agent assign a higher priority based on customer tier
- Allowing the Router to send it to the Product Team (due to category) while still flagging its importance

### 3. Vague or Ambiguous Tickets

Some tickets may be difficult to categorize because they contain minimal information or mix multiple issues. The system addresses this by:

- Encouraging agents to provide detailed reasoning for their decisions
- Allowing the Classifier Agent to use the "general complaint" category when appropriate
- Enabling the Router to default to General Support when uncertainty is high

## Future Improvements

1. **Feedback Loop**: Implement a mechanism to capture agent performance and incorporate feedback
2. **Additional Agents**: Add specialized agents for sentiment analysis or technical complexity assessment
3. **Historical Analysis**: Incorporate analysis of similar past tickets and their resolutions
4. **Confidence Scores**: Have agents provide confidence levels for their classifications
5. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Add capability for human review of uncertain cases

Does this system design document cover all the aspects you wanted to explain? Would you like me to elaborate on any specific section?

## Final Project Assembly

**User**: This is perfect! Can you help me put everything together into a complete project structure?

**AI**: I'll help you assemble everything into a complete project structure. Here's the plan:

1. Create the main project directory: `ayaanshaheer-customer-support-analyzer`
2. Set up all the subdirectories as specified in your requirements
3. Create all the necessary files with the code we've developed

Here's the complete project structure with all files:

I've already provided the code for most of these files. Let me create the remaining ones:

1. `__init__.py` files (empty files to make directories proper Python packages)
2. `requirements.txt` for dependencies

For `requirements.txt`, we'll need:

```
pydantic>=2.0.0
pydantic-ai>=0.1.0  # Adjust version as needed
```

Would you like me to help you implement any specific part of this structure that we haven't covered yet?

**User**: This looks great! I think we've covered everything. Thank you for your help!

**AI**: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help you design and implement this multi-agent customer support ticket analysis system. You now have a complete project with:

1. Two specialized AI agents (Classifier and Priority)
2. A router that combines their outputs
3. An evaluation system with metrics
4. Test cases covering different scenarios
5. Comprehensive documentation

This architecture provides a solid foundation that you can extend and customize as needed. The separation of concerns between classification and prioritization gives you flexibility and maintainability.

If you decide to implement this in a production environment, consider adding:

1. Proper error handling and logging
2. A database to store tickets and agent decisions
3. A feedback mechanism to improve agent performance over time
4. A user interface for support staff

Best of luck with your project! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance.
